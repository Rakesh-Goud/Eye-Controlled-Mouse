# Eye-Controlled-Mouse
Eye Controlled Mouse is an innovative project that allows users to control their computer mouse using eye movements and blinks. Built with OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI, and Streamlit, this application leverages facial landmark detection to track eye positions and translate them into cursor movements on the screen.
